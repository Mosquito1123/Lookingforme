Lookingforme
An **ARKit** App that can do three things:

- Recording the route you've passed by
- Sharing the route with your friends
- Your friends can find the start position of the route, then follow it to find you

#### Recording

Recording the route you've passed by.

#### Sharing

Sharing the route with your friends through social apps such as Line, QQ or Wechat.

#### Searching

Your friends received the route you've sent to them and find the start position of the route according to the picture, then follow the route to find you

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èKey information for the route

- An picture that can help your friends to find the start position
- The scene

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning

You should find the **very start position of the route**, otherwise the route will lead you to an unknown target.

## üëÜImproving

**ARKit** is not so stable now, so we've tried some methods to improve the accuracy of the route, mainly at these two branches:

- [According to location](https://github.com/mmoaay/Findme/tree/feature/location_optimize)
- [According to distance](https://github.com/mmoaay/Findme/tree/feature/distance_optimize)
